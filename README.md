Credit Risk Analysis & Loan Portfolio Dashboard

📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a basic understanding of credit risk analysis in banking and financial services.  
The goal is to analyze customer data to identify risky lending behavior and understand how data can be used to minimize financial losses while lending to customers.

The project uses Python for EDA, SQL for risk analysis queries, and Power BI for dashboard visualization, simulating a real-world banking analytics workflow.

🎯 Problem Statement
> Developing a basic understanding of risk analysis in banking and financial services and understanding how data is used to minimize the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) – Data Cleaning & EDA
- SQL (PostgreSQL) – Risk analysis & business queries
- Power BI – Interactive dashboard & data storytelling
- GitHub – Project version control & documentation

📂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains banking customer information including:

- Demographics (age, gender, nationality, occupation)
- Financials (income, loans, deposits, savings)
- Banking behavior (credit cards, accounts, lending)
- Risk indicators (risk sensitivity, debt ratio, properties owned)
- Customer loyalty and relationship details

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key EDA steps performed:
- Data cleaning & column standardization
- Risk category labeling (Low → Very High Risk)
- Debt ratio calculation
- Outlier detection (high loans vs low income)
- Risk segmentation of customers
- Financial stress analysis

🧮 SQL Risk Analysis
Industry-style SQL queries were written to answer questions such as:
- Who are the high-risk customers?
- What percentage of the loan portfolio is risky?
- Which occupations and locations have higher risk exposure?
- Which customers have loans greater than income?
- How much money is exposed to high-risk segments?
